# Ecommerce-Sales-Dashboard (POWER BI)

**OBJECTIVE**
Owner of Store wants us to help them create a dashboard to track and analyze their online sales across India



The online sales dashboard project with Power BI analyzes data with charts, tables, and filters to provide insights on sales, customers, and products for businesses to make data-driven decisions

Created a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI, where I applied data cleaning techniques to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information presented. Through meticulous data cleansing, I eliminated inconsistencies, corrected errors, and removed any duplicate or irrelevant data, resulting in a refined dataset.

By harnessing the power of Power BI's intuitive interface and powerful visualization capabilities, I transformed the cleansed data into visually appealing charts, graphs, and tables. The dashboard now provides a clear and concise overview of key metrics, enabling users to easily analyze and interpret the information.

With a keen eye for design, I incorporated a visually pleasing layout, ensuring that the dashboard is user-friendly and easy to navigate. By utilizing appropriate color schemes, fonts, and visual elements, I enhanced the overall aesthetic appeal, making the dashboard visually engaging and professional.

Furthermore, I implemented interactive features within the dashboard, allowing users to explore the data dynamically. By utilizing slicers, filters, and drill-down functionality, users can effortlessly delve deeper into specific data subsets and gain valuable insights.

Overall, the Power BI dashboard I created showcases clean and organized data, presented in an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly manner. It empowers users to make informed decisions and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying data trends.
